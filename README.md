In this project, different type of noise (Salt and Pepper, speckle, Poisson, Gaussian) with various parameters are applied to medical, normal and aerial dataset. Then different types of filter (smoothing, sharpening, wavelet, shearlet) are applied to recognize which filter is suitable for each noise.
